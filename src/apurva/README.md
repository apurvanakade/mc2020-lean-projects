# Eigenvalues and Diagonalization

## Resources 

- [LftCM2020: Linear algebra - Anne Baanen's
 lecture video](https://youtu.be/EnZvGCU_jpc)

## Notes

- Looks like there are two different "linear maps" in mathlib - matrices and linear operator. 
- Basic things that are missing 
  - Direct sums of vector spaces 
  - Hilbert spaces 
  - Eigenvalues and eigenspaces of linear operators 
  - Eigenvalues ond eigenspaces of matrices
  
  Will start working on these first.
