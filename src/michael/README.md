# Graph Theory

Look at the `mathlib:hedetniemi` branch to get a sense of what approaches people have taken to defining graphs

Outline of the proof for Konigsberg is not an Eulerian Tour

Prove that a tour implies indegree = outdegree for each vertex

Prove that degree = indegree + outdegree

Prove that there are vertices with odd degree in the Konigsberg graph
